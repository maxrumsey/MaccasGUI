# MaccasGUI
A loosly-based simulation of the McDonalds NewPOS 6.1 system, built with tkinter for a school project.

## What Works:
* Adding items to an order
* Voiding items in an order
* Changing number of items in an order
* Size of Items
* Paying for items
* Viewing amount of items sold for the day.
